# WaterQualitiyMonitoringSystem

1. Sensor Integration: The project involves integrating various sensors such as pH sensors, TDS sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, etc., to measure different parameters of water quality. Each sensor provides data on specific aspects of water quality, allowing for comprehensive monitoring.

2. Data Acquisition and Analysis: The system collects data from the sensors and processes it to assess the water quality. This could involve real-time monitoring and logging of data over time, as well as analyzing trends and deviations from expected values.
